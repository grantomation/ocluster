1. Remember that most assets are in github.com/itil-sa/summer-camp
2. Remember that some stuff are deployed via summer-camp, and some via ocluster.
3. Remember that some secrets may be stored in akeyless, but not all. Check carefully.
4. Try and run on SNO. That's because multuiple EBS PVC are created, and in AWS, nodes in one zone can't mount EBS of another zone. That's a major issue if the same pud tries to mount multiple pods.
5. Remember to specify a large size (300GB?) of volume on openshift-install. The default one (120) was too small. Something based on 1. resize ebs, and 2. growpart /dev/vda 4 && unshare --mount && mount -o rw,remount /sysroot && xfs_growfs /sysroot DID work but was stresfull.
6. Remember that running pipelines in parallel is not such a good idea.
7. remember that ui-super-heroes build was introduced in the ci-piepline, (java-ci), but I think there is some additional changes required in other pipelines.

8. Remember that the latest version of quarkus-super-heroes does not seem to go through the pipeline smoothly.
